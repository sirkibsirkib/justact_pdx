# JustAct PDX

This repo contains a small CLI REPL which digests commands in a little, bespoke DSL for playing out a runtime scenario in the JustAct framework using the Slick policy language.
The tool relies on the JustAct inspector, by Tim MÃ¼ller, to evaluate and visualise the validity of the user-provided policies.

This tool is intended to provide a quick and reproducible means to design and test policy agreements and usages between multiple agents, e.g., for the purposes of inter-organisational data exchange.

The provided example scripts include comments to explain the usage of the tool by example.
